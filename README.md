# zer0zero. CS: GO configuration files

This configuration features:

- Pro player settings. These are based on former Cloud9 player Shroud's config.
- Human-readable explanations for every line of commands
- Gameplay optimizations in technical aspects
  - Minimize shifting when firing the Weapon
  - Disable unnecessary video/audio effects
- Useful shortcuts:
  - Jump throw: `j`
  - Molotov/IncGrenade: `v`
  - Toggle voice chat: `n`
  - Radar zoom keys: `.` and `,`
  - Buydrop key: `p`
  - Clear blood: `ALT`
  - _Hold this posistion_: `h`
  - Numpad quick buy shortcuts
  - `z` for smoke, `x` for flash, `c` for grenade and `v` for fire
- Practice mode: `prac` command. Useful for warmups. By the way, I highly recommend Yprac workshop maps.

I play on 1920 x 1440, 4:3, 240Hz. You probably only need `autoexec.cfg`. You're welcome to fork this and share it to other people!
